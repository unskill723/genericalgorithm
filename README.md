# Topic: NEAT based on simple hybrid RTS/RTT (Real TIme Strategy/Real Time Tactics) simulation
## Goal: To find out whether the NEAT will have an emergent behaviour (such as avoiding getting damage, using tactics that were not intended in code, cooperating with allied units) 
### (Further down an instruction will be provided as well as documentation. If one has questions, they might overview separate Q&A file)
